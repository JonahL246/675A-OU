## Code Goals

Our coding process is geared towards user simplicty while also maintaing conistency between autonomous and driver-controls. We aim to try different coding styles and methods in order to refine this process

One way in which we accomplish this is by using PROS over VEXCode V5. The Purdue Robotics Operating System for VEX V5 Robots (better known as PROS) offers more control and an additional layer of complexity that allows code to be more functional than just driver controls. We can utilize sensors and inputs like the brain screen in various ways and have a refined level of control. Overall, this leads to cleaner and better code.

We also encourage the use of libraries. Libraries are a pre-written, compiled selection of code that slots into a project, allowing the coder to utilize it's functions. We use EZ-Template as our main plugin. Created by EZ Robotics and Harvard-Westlake Robotics, this template easily allows the coder to configure a drivetrain and it's code in as little as 3 numbers - which are all just ports on the brain!

### EZ Template

[EZ-Template Version](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template): 2.1.0

We also use libraries that aid in making and displaying graphs as well as auton functions.
